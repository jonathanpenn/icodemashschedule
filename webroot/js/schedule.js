You&#x2019;ve also been informed that it needs to work on iOS and Android. You think &#x201C;no problem!&#x201D; -- that&#x2019;s what HTML 5 is for! But then you find out that the app needs native features like GPS and a camera. What are you to do?     PhoneGap is an innovative framework that allows you to build mobile apps in HTML 5 that have access to device features reserved for native apps. Simply put: with PhoneGap, you can build HTML 5 apps that can use device features like geolocation, the accelerometer, and even a camera, for example.       In this session, you&#x2019;ll learn how to build a web-based mobile app using HTML 5 and JavaScript that is able to live inside the PhoneGap container and take advantage of native features, such as GPS. You&#x2019;ll see that with PhoneGap the same web app can then be deployed onto an iOS device and an Android one. One app. Multiple device platforms. Job done."}));

It is a logic driven, declarative language that has been around since the 70s.  It is not OOP nor purely functional, and though it has influenced many languages it never really got popular outside of Japan.    That\'s the bad news and most people stop here.  However, the good news is that Prolog allows you to attack certain problems in an elegant and succinct way.  Prolog and Prolog-like languages have found use in a variety of AI, scheduling systems, and the semantic web.      This presentation is directed at novice Prolog programmers and people who may have never seen prolog.  Prolog has very little syntax (more than Fourth, less than Ruby) and so that part is easy (you\'ll get a handout). The hard part of Prolog is that it\'s so different.  We will cover the basics of Prolog and work our way up to a simple expert system.  We will also cover how to use Prolog to consume and provide web services using the LGPL\'d SWI Prolog."}));

At some point, however, developers start to feel Java applications just can&#x2019;t be any simpler because Java itself is not very simple. It is at this juncture that most people look for alternatives. Often, this leads them into the open arms of the Groovy on Grails framework, which is itself built on top of Spring. For those that like to use &#x2013; or want to use &#x2013; Groovy, then this is a fine option. However, there&#x2019;ll always be people using Java and for them a different tact is required. Spring Roo provides the Groovy-on-Grails and Ruby-on-Rails model driven design aesthetic to Java developers through its unique use of compile-time retention aspects that help you build code that ships, quickly. The result of any Roo project is a stock standard Java application that can be deployed with no worries about runtime speed or security. The Roo framework features a vast and growing community of add-on developers that increase the surface area of this already very productive approach to application development.     &amp;nbsp;    &amp;nbsp;In this talk, Josh Long and Steve Mayzak will introduce the Spring Roo development framework, and walk users through a complete, functioning, round-tripable application developed in no time at all. Users will see how productive Java can be once a tool like Roo helps it get out of its own way. Then, they will look at tailoring the framework with Spring Roo add-ons to add plug &#x2018;n play functionality.    "}));

Except &#x2013; not really. There are some imaginary lines drawn around the two disciplines of design and development, but the truth is they are closely intertwined, and it can be very useful for a developer to have design knowledge and skills in his or her toolbox. This presentation will correct some commonly-held misconceptions about design, cover the basics of design from a developer&#x2019;s perspective and explore how a developer can employ these principles to build clearer, cleaner and more usable applications.    Discussion:    What is design, or more to the point, what isn&#x2019;t it? Introducing the design myths we&#x2019;re going to debunk: design is decoration, design is entirely subjective, and design is separate from development.    Myth #1: Design is decoration. Typically, design is defined as only the visual layer on top of website or application. However, design also encompasses structure, content and organization, at all levels of a project.    Myth #2: Design is subjective. True, there is difficult-to-define element of creativity to design. But, just like coding, design has rules and guiding principles, such as those dealing with color theory, typography, negative space, ratios and contrast.    Myth #3: Design is separate from development. They are different disciplines, but having each work in tandem will produce stronger products that won&#x2019;t need design retrofitting later down the road. Developers can facilitate this with a bit of design know-how integrated into their communication and process."}));

Some projects use FindBugs as part of their continuous build system, but find themselves unsure of the return on their investment and wondering if there might be a more effective way to use FindBugs. When first applying FindBugs is a large project and seeing hundreds or thousands of issues, others simply give up on using FindBugs.

Perhaps your familiar with the concept of pair programming for developers?  Tim and Kate will tell you how they have used a similar strategy for merging technology and design to achieve high performance design and implementation cycles.     Within Compuware they have formed a team known as &#x201C;Fisher Pricer&#x201D; which has gained recognition throughout the company for the innovative way they have been working and collaborating side-by-side, merging design and technology on each project they work on.    One of their recent projects was an award winning mobile app for the Maker Faire Detroit which they created from scratch in just a few weeks.  Their style of working enables close collaboration and rapid feedback shaving weeks off a typical back and forth period between a development team and a design team.  Learn how together they conceive the user experience and UI layout for their projects followed by individual yet highly collaborative work on the graphic design and coding of the projects.  Can this strategy work for you?   Join us to learn how it has worked at Compuware."}));

Shannon Code (a developer) and Dawn Code (a tester) describe and demonstrate ATDD (acceptance test driven development), from discussing the story to considering it done done.  Early in the process they agree on story scope and develop a shared vocabulary.  The tester and developer discuss the approach to solving the problem and begin to work out a test approach.  Together, they write a series of acceptance tests to pin down the details of how the story will work.
